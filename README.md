## Overview
### We are using the VSD Squadron Mini which uses the 32-bit CH32V003F4U6 microcontroller based on RISC-V architecture as the Primary Flight Computer

## Features
### 1. VSD Squadron Mini as the primary flight computer
### 2. NRF24L01 PA+LNA for near range radio communication
### 3. Arduino Nano as the communication interface between NRF24L01 PA+LNA and VSD Squadron Mini (Arduinon nRF doesn't support RISC-V boards a new library is in development)
